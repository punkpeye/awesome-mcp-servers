# awesome_mcp_servers.ai.index — [Project Name]
# Searchable index. Every entry is greppable. One line per item.
# RULE: Every entry MUST have a verifiable reference — either:
#   → path/file.py:LINE  (file + line number, validated by CI)
#   | GREP: grep "pattern" file  (grep command, validated by CI)
# Entries without verifiable refs will FAIL CI validation.
# Validator: ci/validate-ai-index.sh (from lbf-templates)

## Features (by version)
# vX.Y.Z: Feature name → src/feature.py:1 | GREP: grep "feature_flag" src/config.py

## Log Signatures
# [log] PATTERN_NAME: what it means | GREP: grep "pattern" logfile
# [log] ERROR_NAME: what went wrong | GREP: grep "error" logfile

## Classes
# [class] ClassName → src/file.py:42 — What this class does

## Functions
# [fn] function_name → src/file.py:100 — What this function does

## Constants / Config
# [const] IMPORTANT_VALUE → src/config.py:10 — What this controls

## API Endpoints
# [api] METHOD /path → handler_file.py:50 — What it does

## Test Suites
# [test] TestClassName → tests/test_file.py:15 — What this tests

## Behavioral Markers
# [marker] MARKER_NAME: what it indicates | GREP: grep "pattern" logfile
# [marker] HEALTH_CHECK: system is healthy | GREP: grep "OK\|healthy" logfile

## Key Patterns
# [pattern] name → src/file.py:200 — Brief description of architectural pattern used

## Debugging Cheat Sheet
# If you see [X] → check [Y feature] in .ai.register
# If [A] is broken | GREP: grep "error_pattern" logfile
# If tests fail → run [command] to isolate
